# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Does it happen every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**

   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**
   ```
   For EACH component boundary:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation
     - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

   **Example (multi-layer system):**
   ```bash
   # Layer 1: Workflow
   echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
   echo "IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}"

   # Layer 2: Build script
   echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
   env | grep IDENTITY || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

   # Layer 3: Signing script
   echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
   security list-keychains
   security find-identity -v

   # Layer 4: Actual signing
   codesign --sign "$IDENTITY" --verbose=4 "$APP"
   ```

   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)

5. **Trace Data Flow**

   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.

   **Quick version:**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line
   - Understand the pattern fully before applying

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - One-off test script if no framework
   - MUST have before fixing
   - Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements
   - No bundled refactoring

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?

4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**
   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**

   **Pattern indicating architectural problem:**
   - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place
   - Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

   **STOP and question fundamentals:**
   - Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
   - Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
   - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

   **Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**

   This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5)

## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultrathink this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Supporting Techniques

These techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:

- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling

**Related skills:**
- **superpowers:test-driven-development** - For creating failing test case (Phase 4, Step 1)
- **superpowers:verification-before-completion** - Verify fix worked before claiming success

## Real-World Impact

From debugging sessions:
- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix
- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing
- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%
- New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common

# Debugging Wizard

Expert debugger applying systematic methodology to isolate and resolve issues in any codebase.

## Core Workflow

1. **Reproduce** - Establish consistent reproduction steps
2. **Isolate** - Narrow down to smallest failing case
3. **Hypothesize and test** - Form testable theories, verify/disprove each one
4. **Fix** - Implement and verify solution
5. **Prevent** - Add tests/safeguards against regression

- Assume you know the cause
- Debug in production without safeguards
- Leave console.log/debugger statements in code

## Common Debugging Commands

**Python (pdb)**
```bash
python -m pdb script.py          # launch debugger
# inside pdb:
# b 42          — set breakpoint at line 42
# n             — step over
# s             — step into
# p some_var    — print variable
# bt            — print full traceback
```

**JavaScript (Node.js)**
```bash
node --inspect-brk script.js     # pause at first line, attach Chrome DevTools
# In Chrome: open chrome://inspect → click "inspect"
# Sources panel: add breakpoints, watch expressions, step through
```

**Git bisect (regression hunting)**
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad                   # current commit is broken
git bisect good v1.2.0           # last known good tag/commit
# Git checks out midpoint — test, then:
git bisect good   # or: git bisect bad
# Repeat until git identifies the first bad commit
git bisect reset
```

**Go (delve)**
```bash
dlv debug ./cmd/server           # build & attach
# (dlv) break main.go:55
# (dlv) continue
# (dlv) print myVar
```

## Output Templates

When debugging, provide:
1. **Root Cause**: What specifically caused the issue
2. **Evidence**: Stack trace, logs, or test that proves it
3. **Fix**: Code change that resolves it
4. **Prevention**: Test or safeguard to prevent recurrence

# Common Bug Patterns

## Pattern Recognition

| Pattern | Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Race condition | Intermittent failures | Missing await, async timing |
| Off-by-one | Missing first/last item | `<` vs `<=`, array bounds |
| Null reference | "undefined is not..." | Missing null check |
| Memory leak | Growing memory | Uncleaned listeners/intervals |
| N+1 queries | Slow with more data | Fetching in loop |
| Type coercion | Unexpected behavior | `==` instead of `===` |
| Closure issue | Wrong variable value | Loop variable capture |
| Stale state | Old value used | React state closure |

## Race Condition

```typescript
// BUG: Race condition
let data;
fetchData().then(result => { data = result; });
console.log(data); // undefined!

// FIX: Await the result
const data = await fetchData();
console.log(data);
```

## Off-by-One

```typescript
// BUG: Skips last element
for (let i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) { }

// FIX: Include last element
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { }

// BUG: Array index out of bounds
const last = array[array.length]; // undefined

// FIX: Correct index
const last = array[array.length - 1];
```

## Null Reference

```typescript
// BUG: Crashes if user is null
const name = user.profile.name;

// FIX: Optional chaining
const name = user?.profile?.name ?? 'Unknown';

// FIX: Guard clause
if (!user?.profile) {
  return 'Unknown';
}
return user.profile.name;
```

## Memory Leak

```typescript
// BUG: Listener never removed
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);

// FIX: Cleanup function
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);

// BUG: Interval never cleared
setInterval(pollData, 1000);

// FIX: Store and clear
const intervalId = setInterval(pollData, 1000);
return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
```

## Closure in Loop

```typescript
// BUG: All callbacks use i = 5
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}

// FIX: Use let (block scoped)
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}

// FIX: Capture in closure
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ((j) => setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 100))(i);
}
```

## React Stale State

```typescript
// BUG: count is stale in closure
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
useEffect(() => {
  setInterval(() => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Always uses initial count
  }, 1000);
}, []);

// FIX: Use functional update
setCount(prev => prev + 1);

// FIX: Include in dependency array with cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(() => setCount(c => c + 1), 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(id);
}, []);
```

## Quick Reference

| Symptom | First Check |
|---------|-------------|
| "undefined is not..." | Null check missing |
| Works sometimes | Race condition |
| Wrong value in callback | Closure/stale state |
| Gets slower over time | Memory leak, N+1 |
| Off by one item | Loop bounds, array index |
| Type mismatch | `==` vs `===`, coercion |

# Quick Fixes

## TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined

```typescript
// Error
user.profile.name
// user or profile is undefined

// Fix: Optional chaining
user?.profile?.name

// Fix: Default value
user?.profile?.name ?? 'Unknown'

// Fix: Guard clause
if (!user?.profile) {
  return null;
}
return user.profile.name;
```

## Unhandled Promise Rejection

```typescript
// Error
fetchData().then(process);
// What if fetchData rejects?

// Fix: Add catch
fetchData()
  .then(process)
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Fetch failed:', error);
  });

// Fix: try/catch with await
try {
  const data = await fetchData();
  await process(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
}
```

## React: Too Many Re-renders

```typescript
// Error: Calling setState during render
function Component() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  setCount(count + 1); // Infinite loop!
}

// Fix: Use useEffect for side effects
function Component() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }, []); // Only on mount
}

// Error: Object/array in dependency array
useEffect(() => {}, [{ a: 1 }]); // New object every render!

// Fix: Memoize or use primitives
const config = useMemo(() => ({ a: 1 }), []);
useEffect(() => {}, [config]);
```

## CORS Error

```typescript
// Browser blocks cross-origin request

// Fix 1: Server - Add CORS headers
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true,
}));

// Fix 2: Proxy in development (Vite)
// vite.config.ts
export default {
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': 'http://localhost:8000',
    },
  },
};
```

## Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded

```typescript
// Error: Infinite recursion
function factorial(n) {
  return n * factorial(n - 1); // No base case!
}

// Fix: Add base case
function factorial(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

// Error: Circular dependency in objects
const a = {};
const b = { ref: a };
a.ref = b;
JSON.stringify(a); // Fails!

// Fix: Break circular reference
JSON.stringify(a, (key, value) => {
  if (key === 'ref') return '[Circular]';
  return value;
});
```

## Module Not Found

```bash
# Error: Cannot find module 'x'

# Fix 1: Install the package
npm install x

# Fix 2: Check import path
import x from './x';     # Relative - needs ./
import x from 'x';       # Package - no ./

# Fix 3: Check file extension
import x from './x.js';  # ESM may need extension

# Fix 4: Clear cache
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## Async/Await Issues

```typescript
// Error: await in non-async function
function getData() {
  const data = await fetch('/api'); // SyntaxError!
}

// Fix: Mark function as async
async function getData() {
  const data = await fetch('/api');
}

// Error: forEach doesn't await
items.forEach(async item => {
  await process(item); // Doesn't wait!
});

// Fix: Use for...of
for (const item of items) {
  await process(item);
}

// Fix: Use Promise.all for parallel
await Promise.all(items.map(item => process(item)));
```

## Quick Reference

| Error Message | Likely Fix |
|--------------|------------|
| Cannot read property of undefined | Optional chaining `?.` |
| Unhandled promise rejection | Add `.catch()` or try/catch |
| Too many re-renders | Remove setState from render |
| CORS error | Add CORS headers on server |
| Maximum call stack | Add recursion base case |
| Module not found | Check path, install package |
| await in non-async | Add `async` keyword |

# Debugging Strategies

## Binary Search

Divide and conquer to find the bug location.

```markdown
1. Comment out/disable half the code
2. Test if bug still occurs
3. If yes: bug is in remaining half
4. If no: bug is in disabled half
5. Repeat until isolated
```

```typescript
// Example: Bug in data processing pipeline
async function process(data) {
  const step1 = await transform(data);
  // Bug somewhere below?

  const step2 = await validate(step1);
  console.log('After step2:', step2); // Check here

  const step3 = await enrich(step2);
  const step4 = await save(step3);
  return step4;
}
```

## Minimal Reproduction

Strip away everything until only the bug remains.

```markdown
1. Create new minimal project
2. Add only code needed to reproduce
3. Remove dependencies one by one
4. Simplify inputs to smallest failing case
5. Document exact reproduction steps
```

```typescript
// Instead of debugging full app
// Create minimal test case:
const input = { id: null }; // Minimal failing input
const result = processUser(input);
console.log(result); // Isolate the exact failure
```

## Git Bisect

Find the commit that introduced the bug.

```bash
# Start bisect
git bisect start

# Mark current commit as bad
git bisect bad

# Mark known good commit
git bisect good v1.0.0

# Git checks out middle commit
# Test and mark:
git bisect good  # or
git bisect bad

# Repeat until found
# Git will say: "abc123 is the first bad commit"

# End bisect
git bisect reset
```

```bash
# Automated bisect with test script
git bisect start HEAD v1.0.0
git bisect run npm test
```

## Time Travel Debugging

Work backwards from the failure.

```markdown
1. Start at the error/failure point
2. What value caused it? Where did that come from?
3. Trace backwards through the code
4. Find where the value diverged from expected
```

```typescript
// Error: Cannot read 'name' of undefined at line 45

// Line 45: const name = user.name;
// Q: Why is user undefined?

// Line 40: const user = users.find(u => u.id === id);
// Q: Why didn't find() return a user?

// Check: Is the id correct? Are users populated?
console.log({ id, users, user });
```

## Rubber Duck Debugging

Explain the problem step by step.

```markdown
1. State what the code should do
2. Explain what it actually does
3. Walk through the code line by line
4. Describe what each line does
5. The discrepancy often becomes obvious
```

## Delta Debugging

When something recently broke.

```bash
# Check what changed
git diff HEAD~5..HEAD

# Check specific file history
git log -p --follow -- src/problematic-file.ts

# Find when file last worked
git log --oneline -- src/problematic-file.ts
```

## Quick Reference

| Strategy | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| Binary Search | Unknown bug location |
| Minimal Repro | Complex bugs, reporting |
| Git Bisect | Regression bugs |
| Time Travel | Known error location |
| Rubber Duck | Logic errors |
| Delta Debug | Recent breakage |

# Systematic Debugging

## Core Principle

> **NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

Jumping to fixes without understanding causes creates more bugs. Systematic debugging prevents the "fix one thing, break two more" cycle.

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**Objective:** Understand exactly what is failing and why before attempting any fix.

### Step 1.1: Read Error Messages Thoroughly

```bash
# Don't just read the first line
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
    at UserList.render (UserList.tsx:24)
    at renderWithHooks (react-dom.js:14985)
    at mountIndeterminateComponent (react-dom.js:17811)
```

**Key questions:**
- What exact operation failed?
- Where in the code (file, line)?
- What was the call stack?
- Are there multiple errors or just one?

### Step 1.2: Reproduce Reliably

```markdown
## Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to /users
2. Click "Load More" button
3. Wait for loading spinner
4. **ERROR: "Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"**

## Environment
- Browser: Chrome 120
- User: Admin role
- Data state: 50+ users in database
```

**Requirement:** Document exact steps that reproduce the bug 100% of the time.

### Step 1.3: Examine Recent Changes

```bash
# What changed recently?
git log --oneline -10

# What specifically changed in the failing file?
git log -p UserList.tsx

# When did this start failing?
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v1.2.0
```

### Step 1.4: Trace Data Flow Backward

```typescript
// Error happens here:
users.map(u => u.name)  // users is undefined

// Trace backward:
// Where does 'users' come from?
const users = props.users;

// Where do props come from?
<UserList users={data.users} />

// Where does data come from?
const { data } = useQuery(GET_USERS);

// ROOT CAUSE: Query returns { users: null } when loading
```

### Step 1.5: Add Diagnostic Instrumentation

```typescript
// Add temporary logging at boundaries
console.log('[UserList] props:', JSON.stringify(props));
console.log('[UserList] users type:', typeof props.users);
console.log('[UserList] users value:', props.users);

// Check at data source
console.log('[API] Response:', response);
console.log('[API] Response.data:', response.data);
```

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Objective:** Find working examples to understand what correct behavior looks like.

### Step 2.1: Locate Similar Working Implementations

```bash
# Find similar components that work correctly
grep -r "useQuery" src/components/ --include="*.tsx"

# Find how other lists handle loading states
grep -r "loading" src/components/*List* --include="*.tsx"
```

### Step 2.2: Study Reference Implementations Completely

```typescript
// WORKING: ProductList.tsx
function ProductList({ products, loading }) {
  if (loading) return <Spinner />;
  if (!products) return null;  // ← Handles undefined case

  return products.map(p => <ProductItem key={p.id} {...p} />);
}

// BROKEN: UserList.tsx
function UserList({ users, loading }) {
  if (loading) return <Spinner />;
  // Missing: !users check

  return users.map(u => <UserItem key={u.id} {...u} />);  // 💥 Crashes
}
```

### Step 2.3: Document All Differences

| Aspect | Working (ProductList) | Broken (UserList) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Null check | `if (!products)` | Missing |
| Default value | `products ?? []` | None |
| Loading handled | Before render | Before render |
| Error handled | Returns ErrorState | Missing |

---

## Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

**Objective:** Verify your understanding with controlled experiments.

### Step 3.1: Form Specific, Written Hypothesis

```markdown
## Hypothesis #1
**Statement:** The crash occurs because `users` is undefined when the
query is complete but returns no data.

**Prediction:** Adding a null check before `.map()` will prevent the crash.

**Test:** Add `if (!users) return null;` before the map call.
```

### Step 3.2: Test with Minimal Changes

```typescript
// Change ONLY one thing
function UserList({ users, loading }) {
  if (loading) return <Spinner />;
  if (!users) return null;  // ← Single change

  return users.map(u => <UserItem key={u.id} {...u} />);
}
```

### Step 3.3: One Variable at a Time

```markdown
## Test Results

| Hypothesis | Change | Result | Conclusion |
|------------|--------|--------|------------|
| #1: Null check | Add `if (!users)` | ✓ Pass | Confirmed |

Do NOT test multiple hypotheses simultaneously.
```

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

**Objective:** Fix the bug permanently with proper safeguards.

### Step 4.1: Create Failing Test Case First

```typescript
describe('UserList', () => {
  it('should handle undefined users gracefully', () => {
    // This test should FAIL before the fix
    const { container } = render(<UserList users={undefined} loading={false} />);
    expect(container).not.toThrow();
    expect(screen.queryByRole('list')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Step 4.2: Implement Single Fix

```typescript
function UserList({ users, loading }: UserListProps) {
  if (loading) return <Spinner />;
  if (!users || users.length === 0) {
    return <EmptyState message="No users found" />;
  }

  return (
    <ul role="list">
      {users.map(u => <UserItem key={u.id} {...u} />)}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

### Step 4.3: Verify No New Breakage

```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test

# Run specific component tests
npm test UserList

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Verify in browser
# 1. Normal case: 50 users
# 2. Empty case: 0 users
# 3. Loading case: spinner shows
# 4. Error case: error message shows
```

## The Three-Fix Threshold

> **After 3 failed fix attempts → STOP.**

Three failures in different locations signals architectural problems, not isolated bugs.

### What Three Failures Means

```
Fix Attempt 1: Added null check → New error in child component
Fix Attempt 2: Fixed child component → New error in parent
Fix Attempt 3: Fixed parent → Original error returns
                              ↓
                    STOP. QUESTION ARCHITECTURE.
```

### At the Threshold, Do This

1. **Stop fixing symptoms**
2. **Document the pattern** of failures
3. **Identify architectural assumptions** being violated
4. **Propose structural change** rather than patch
5. **Discuss with team** before proceeding

## Red Flags Requiring Process Reset

When you notice these, stop and restart from Phase 1:

| Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| Proposing solutions before tracing data flow | Guessing, not debugging |
| Making multiple simultaneous changes | Can't identify which change worked |
| Skipping test creation | Bug will recur |
| "Let's try this and see if it works" | Shotgun debugging |
| Fixing without understanding the cause | Band-aid, not cure |
